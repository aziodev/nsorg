# nsorg [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/immoh/nsorg.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/immoh/nsorg) [![Dependencies Status](https://jarkeeper.com/immoh/nsorg/status.svg)](https://jarkeeper.com/immoh/nsorg)

Clojure library for organizing `ns` form in a way that whitespace and comments are preserved.

Rules to apply are fully customizable; the default implementation

* sorts `:require`, `:require-macros`, `:use` and `:use-macros` libspecs alphabetically
* sorts `:import` class names alphabetically
* sorts `:exclude`, `:only`, `:refer`, `:refer-macros` and `:rename` options alphabetically

Also available as Leiningen plugin: [lein-nsorg](https://github.com/immoh/lein-nsorg/)


## Installation

Dependency information:

```clj
[nsorg "0.1.3"]
```

## Usage

```clj
(require '[nsorg.core :as nsorg])

(println (nsorg/rewrite-ns-form "
(ns foo
  ;; use
  (:use [a.c :only [y z x]]
        a
        [a.b]
))
"))

(ns foo
  ;; use
  (:use a
        [a.b]
        [a.c :only [x y z]]
))
```

Check [API documentation](https://immoh.github.io/nsorg/) for more details.


## Limitations

* Throws exception on some valid ns forms
* Doesn't sort `:refer`, `:load` or `:gen-class` clauses
